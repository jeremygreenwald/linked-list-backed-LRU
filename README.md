# linked-list-backed-LRU
This was a interview question that bombed real bad (started flop sweating and everything) because I got hung up 
assuming there wasn't enough time to implement a linked list and an LRU cache. So I sent a long time trying to
come up with a way to use mulitple `dict`s within the LRU cache. After the interview ended I decided that 
I might as well practice implementing a basic data structure like a linked list in python and then actually 
finish the LRU cache. Unit tests included.

Note, the linked list is not necessarily completely implemented, just enough to serve as part 
of the LRU cache.
